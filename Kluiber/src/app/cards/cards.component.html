                    This charming Madeiran Quinta was built in the 18th century. More recently it was the home of well-known French and British families. During the Napoleonic wars General Beresford, Commander of the British forces on the island, chose
                    it as his residence. His magnificent sideboard, a reminder of his stay, still adorns our dining room. Today, Quinta Jardins do Lago, with 31 double rooms, 4 Historical Junior Suites, 4 Premier Suites and 1 Presidencial Suite, all facing
                    south to the luscious gardens, have been passionately designed to offer the best accommodation with modern functionality in traditional comfort and style. This is undoubtedly one of the many reasons why we have become Madeira islands
                    most sought after small luxury botanical garden hotel. The lush gardens are absolutely amazing with more than 500 different species of plants which are unique in their variety and natural beauty. With an area of 2.5 hectares full of
                    wonderful examples of rare species and old trees as well as many colourful and delicate flowers, the Flora of ‘Quinta Jardins do Lago‘ is such a rich and diverse collection that it can rival any good botanical gardens.
